## About

`pup` is a small proof-of-concept codebase for running ML models on video data
using rust.

The main libraries are `opencv` for video processing and `ONNX Runtime` via the `ort` crate as the deep learning framework.

### _Why?_

You may be asking why rust, when it's far easier to get up and running using the
python equivalent libraries that are out there. While this is absolutely true,
rust has several advantages in this context:

1. **Cross-compiling for hardware agnostic deployment**. By leveraging the rust
   tool-chain ecosystem, we can easily compile an application with a specific
   target in mind. This allows for a single codebase to be used to create
   executable binaries across many different hardware.

2. **Far greater control over memory usage, binary size and level of
   optimizations**. Python is fantastic for flexibility and rapid prototyping, but
   if we want an application that is to be run in resource constrained settings,
   we want full control over the memory footprint and runtime as possible. Rust
   as a statically typed, memory safe, language gives the programmer the power
   to develop with confidence of how memory is being used.

### _What?_

What's going on here then? This repo uses YOLOv8 ONNX models for object detection 
and applies inference to video frames using ONNX Runtime. The model itself could
of course be switched out for any other object detection architecture, this was
chosen as a robust approach combining `opencv` with `ONNX Runtime` for high-performance inference.

## Usage

There are two main binaries available with different purposes:

## **`pup` (Main Binary)**
**Professional GStreamer-based video processing system**

- **Architecture**: Clean, modular design using proper abstractions
- **Pipeline**: Full GStreamer VideoPipeline with FrameProcessor architecture  
- **Configuration**: TOML config file support + command-line arguments
- **Purpose**: Production-ready real-time object detection system
- **Target Users**: Production/Integration environments

```bash
# Process video file
cargo run --release --bin pup -- --model models/yolov8n.onnx --video assets/sample.mp4

# Process webcam input
cargo run --release --bin pup -- --model models/yolov8n.onnx --video webcam

# With configuration file
cargo run --release --bin pup -- --config config.toml
```

## **`demo` (Demo Binary)**
**Feature-rich demonstration and development tool**

- **Architecture**: Self-contained demo with multiple specialised modes
- **Pipeline**: Custom GStreamer pipelines built per mode
- **Configuration**: Command-line only with sensible defaults
- **Purpose**: Showcase capabilities, development testing, and experimentation
- **Target Users**: Development/Demo purposes

### Available Demo Modes:

```bash
# Live video with real-time YOLO bounding box overlays (⭐ recommended)
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode live --input webcam
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode live --input assets/sample.mp4

# Terminal-only detection with file logging
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode detection --input assets/sample.mp4

# Video processing with terminal output (no display window)
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode visual --input assets/sample.mp4

# Basic video playback without inference
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode playback --input webcam

# Save processed video (under development)
cargo run --release --bin demo -- --mode file-output --output processed.mp4
```

### Key Differences:

| Aspect | `pup` (Main) | `demo` (Demo) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Target Users** | Production/Integration | Development/Demo |
| **Complexity** | Clean, modular | Feature-rich, experimental |
| **Visual Output** | Text-based | **Real-time video overlays** |
| **Configuration** | TOML + CLI | CLI only |
| **Video Display** | Minimal | Multiple modes including live overlays |
| **Font Rendering** | None | Built-in bitmap fonts |
| **Use Cases** | Integration, automation | Demos, development, testing |

The **`demo` binary is more visually impressive** - especially `--mode live` which shows real-time bounding boxes drawn directly on video. The **`pup` binary is more suitable for production use** with its clean architecture and configuration management.

> ❕ This assumes rust is installed on the host system. If not one can run: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

> ⚠️ **Model Required**: You need a YOLOv8 ONNX model file. Download `yolov8n.onnx` and place it in the `models/` directory.

This will fire up a window like below and annotate objects in each frame:

![Alt Text](assets/output.gif)

Information about the location of the boxes and the identified objects will be
sent to stdout...

## Memory Footprint

With current optimization settings, i.e. using `--release` flag will set
`opt-level` to 3, for better speed. We could optimise for small binary size, but
performance will be slower. See the [Cargo
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) or
https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust for details on making the resulting
binary smaller or faster. As it stands, the resulting binary is ~ 5Mb

```bash
$ du -sh target/release/pup
5.7M    pup
```

If we use those tips and tricks such as:

```diff
+ [profile.release]
+ codegen-units = 1   # Reduce number of codegen units to increase optimizations.
+ lto = true          # Enable Link Time Optimization
+ opt-level = "z"     # Optimize for size.
+ panic = "abort"     # Abort on panic
+ strip = true        # Automatically strip symbols from the binary.
```

we can get this down further to ~ 3Mb.

```bash
$ cargo clean && cargo +nightly run --release -- --video assets/sample.mp4
$ du -sh target/release/pup
2.8M    pup
```

### `cargo-bloat` & `cargo-size`

Two handy cargo crates for inspecting and profiling for where the memory is
being used up is [`cargo bloat`](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat) and
[`cargo size`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils) with the latter
being syntactic-sugar for the `rust-size` utility found in rust-embedded's
`cargo-binutils` crate.

```bash
$ rust-size -A target/release/pup
target/release/pup  :
section                 size         addr
__text               1576592   4294984896
__stubs                 1620   4296561488
__stub_helper           1620   4296563108

__unwind_info          21592   4297588628
__eh_frame             42712   4297610224
__got                     80   4297654272
__const                73816   4297654352
__la_symbol_ptr         1064   4297736192
__data                  1712   4297737256
__thread_vars            672   4297738968
__thread_data             64   4297739640
__thread_bss             392   4297739704
__bss                   1128   4297740096
__common                   4   4297741224
Total                2746960

```

With the above numbers in bytes, i.e. 2746960 bytes ~ 2.8Mb.

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bloat --release -n 10

36.0% 100.0%   1.5MiB              .text section size, the file size is 4.2MiB
```

**Note**, the above does not include all the optimizations listed previously so
it is re-compiled and the `.text` section size is of the order `4Mb`. But it
gives us a good indication as to where the bulk of the code is being used up.

```bash
$ du -sh target/release/pup
4.2M    target/release/pup
```

We can also look at which crates take up the most space:

```bash
   Compiling pup v0.1.0 ...
   ....
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 1m 39s
    Analyzing target/release/pup

35.5% 100.0%   1.5MiB .text section size, the file size is 4.3MiB

Note: numbers above are a result of guesswork. They are not 100% correct and never will be.

```

We can see the `url` crate is taking up a lot of space which may be linked to
how to pull down weights. If we move to an `ORT` model serving method we could
potentially save here, _but let's see how we go_

## Runtime

To investigate the runtime memory footprint we can use `leaks` utility on macOS.

```bash
$ leaks --atExit -- ./target/release/pup --video assets/sample.mp4

Process 24864: 19369 nodes malloced for 34590 KB

```

This gives an average memory usage of ~100Mb and total peak memory usage of
~690Mb.

_Chatgpt summary of Peak Physical vs. Physical:_

> The terms "physical memory footprint" and "peak physical memory footprint" both
> relate to the amount of physical memory (RAM) used by a process or application, but they capture different aspects of memory usage:
>
> 1. **Physical Memory Footprint:**
>
> - The physical memory footprint generally refers to the amount of RAM that a process or application is actively using at a specific point in time or on average during its execution. - It represents the current or average memory consumption and is not necessarily the maximum amount of memory used throughout the entire runtime of the process.
>
> 2. **Peak Physical Memory Footprint:**
>
> - The peak physical memory footprint specifically refers to the maximum amount of RAM that a process or application has used during its entire execution. - It represents the highest point of memory consumption reached by the process or application.
>   In summary, the physical memory footprint gives you an idea of the current or average memory usage, while the peak physical memory footprint highlights the maximum memory usage observed over the entire lifetime of the process or application. Monitoring both metrics is important for understanding how an application utilizes memory resources and for optimizing performance and resource management.

As an aside, here is a snippet of the python example (note, they are not the
same program and this is only show as an illustration)

Note the memory leaks 😬, albeit tiny ..

## Cross-compiling (wip) 🚧

One of the most attractive things about using rust is the tools that are
available to cross-compile to various hardware. Currently `pup` has been
developed using an arm64 macOS system.

```bash
$ file target/release/pup

target/release/pup: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

If we want to instead have an ELF or runnable binary, this can easily done using
cargo and including the right tools in `.cargo/config.toml`:

That said, it is notoriously fiddly to cross compile going from macOS --> Linux.
It is advisable to read over https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross or look into
docker based tools such as https://github.com/cross-rs/cross or
https://github.com/rust-cross/rust-musl-cross
